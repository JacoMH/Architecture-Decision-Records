# Decision to choose Technology to host the databases for Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

A reliable technology is needed to host the databases and MQTT server required for the application
## Considered Options

* Docker
* Xampp

## Decision Outcome

Docker, because it can run many technologies such as my MQTT server and postgresql that Xampp cannot
### Consequences

* Good, provides all databases and the MQTT server a containerized environment to run inside
