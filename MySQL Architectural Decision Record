## Context and Problem Statement

We need a database that can handle simple write tasks to be apart of a mock microservice 
## Considered Options

* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* NoSQL 
## Decision Outcome

MySQL, because it is a light database suitable for low complexity Inserts
### Consequences

* Good, because it will be less resource intensive
* Bad, because if there is a high frequency of writes, it could slow down
