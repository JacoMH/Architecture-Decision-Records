# Decision to choose technology to communicate with the databases for the Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

A reliable technology is needed to communicate and exchange data with databases and servers
## Considered Options

* direct SQL
* prisma

## Decision Outcome

prisma, because it uses schemas to then allow you to write about the databases in more readable code
### Consequences

* Good, provides the ability to create schemas and push them to the database, ensuring that the schema is accurate to your diagram
* Bad, doesnt natively support materialized view, have to use standard sql instead
