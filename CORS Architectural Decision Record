# Decision to choose pattern for backend communication

## Context and Problem Statement

During initial development of the proof-of-concept, i came across CORS errors which stopped API calls from the frontend communicating with the backend

## Considered Options

* Installing CORS package 
* BFF pattern

## Decision Outcome

I decided after initially using the CORS package to switch to the BFF pattern as it stops the exposure to potential data leaks
### Consequences

* Good, the data in the system is now more secure from potential data leaks as the data communicates through an api middleman instead of directly with the backend
* Good, no more CORS browser errors when API calls are made
