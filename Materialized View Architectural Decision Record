# Decision to choose the table used for the PostgreSQL database

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a table that can provide suitable storage for complaint information and provide fast reads as to make sure its able to be scaled

## Considered Options

* Standard Table
* Materialized View

## Decision Outcome

Materialized View, as it offloads the calculation workload onto the backend rather than the frontend

### Consequences

* Good, because the calculations are carried out in the backend so api calls are much faster
* Bad, data isnt always upto date completely as the tables have to refresh periodically
