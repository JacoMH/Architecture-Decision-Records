# Decision to choose Technology to host the backend logic for Complaint Management System

## Context and Problem Statement

A reliable technology is needed to work with the next.js frontend for the microservice backend logic
## Considered Options

* Node.js+express.js
* Next.js

## Decision Outcome

Node.js + Express.js, because they are apart of the javascript ecosystem and require minimal setup to work together
### Consequences

* Good, since they are apart of the same ecosystem, its easy frontend backend sharing
* Bad, could become overwhelming with too many different technologies involved, could potentially be easier only having one
